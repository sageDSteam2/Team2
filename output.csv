Life Sciences,Environmental Science,Wi-Fi is an important threat to human health,"Environmental ResearchVolume 164, July 2018, Pages 405-416",Martin L.Pall,"Repeated Wi-Fi studies show that Wi-Fi causes oxidative stress, sperm/testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG changes, apoptosis, cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, and calcium overload. Each of these effects are also caused by exposures to other microwave frequency EMFs, with each such effect being documented in from 10 to 16 reviews. Therefore, each of these seven EMF effects are established effects of Wi-Fi and of other microwave frequency EMFs. Each of these seven is also produced by downstream effects of the main action of such EMFs, voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) activation. While VGCC activation via EMF interaction with the VGCC voltage sensor seems to be the predominant mechanism of action of EMFs, other mechanisms appear to have minor roles. Minor roles include activation of other voltage-gated ion channels, calcium cyclotron resonance and the geomagnetic magnetoreception mechanism. Five properties of non-thermal EMF effects are discussed. These are that pulsed EMFs are, in most cases, more active than are non-pulsed EMFs; artificial EMFs are polarized and such polarized EMFs are much more active than non-polarized EMFs; dose-response curves are non-linear and non-monotone; EMF effects are often cumulative; and EMFs may impact young people more than adults. These general findings and data presented earlier on Wi-Fi effects were used to assess the Foster and Moulder (F&M) review of Wi-Fi. The F&M study claimed that there were seven important studies of Wi-Fi that each showed no effect. However, none of these were Wi-Fi studies, with each differing from genuine Wi-Fi in three distinct ways. F&M could, at most conclude that there was no statistically significant evidence of an effect. The tiny numbers studied in each of these seven F&M-linked studies show that each of them lack power to make any substantive conclusions. In conclusion, there are seven repeatedly found Wi-Fi effects which have also been shown to be caused by other similar EMF exposures. Each of the seven should be considered, therefore, as established effects of Wi-Fi.",Electromagnetic field (EMF)Brain impactTestis/sperm count and qualityImpact of pulsation and polarizationActivation of voltage-gated calcium channelsWi-Fi or WiFi,"[('Wi-Fi', 10), ('effects', 10), ('EMFs', 10), ('EMF', 5), ('studies', 4), ('F', 4), ('calcium', 3), ('Each', 3), ('effect', 3), ('VGCC', 3)]","['Repeated', 'causes', 'oxidative', 'stress', 'sperm/testicular', 'neuropsychiatric', 'including', 'EEG', 'apoptosis', 'cellular', 'DNA', 'endocrine', 'overload', 'documented', 'reviews', 'Therefore', 'produced', 'downstream', 'channel', 'While', 'via', 'interaction', 'voltage', 'sensor', 'predominant', 'mechanisms', 'appear', 'minor', 'Minor', 'include', 'ion', 'channels', 'cyclotron', 'resonance', 'geomagnetic', 'magnetoreception', 'Five', 'properties', 'non-thermal', 'discussed', 'pulsed', 'cases', 'non-pulsed', 'artificial', 'non-polarized', 'dose-response', 'curves', 'non-linear', 'non-monotone', 'often', 'cumulative', 'impact', 'young', 'people', 'adults', 'general', 'findings', 'data', 'presented', 'earlier', 'used', 'assess', 'Foster', 'Moulder', 'review', 'study', 'claimed', 'important', 'showed', 'However', 'differing', 'genuine', 'three', 'distinct', 'ways', 'conclude', 'statistically', 'significant', 'evidence', 'tiny', 'numbers', 'studied', 'M-linked', 'lack', 'power', 'make', 'substantive', 'conclusions', 'conclusion', 'repeatedly', 'found', 'shown', 'similar', 'considered', 'therefore']"
Life Sciences,Environmental Science,Worldwide decline of the entomofauna: A review of its drivers,"Biological ConservationVolume 232, April 2019, Pages 8-27",FranciscoSánchez-BayoaKris A.G.Wyckhuysbcd,"Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.",ExtinctionPollinatorsAquatic insectsAgriculturePesticidesEcosystem servicesGlobal change ecology,"[('species', 9), ('insect', 4), ('agricultural', 3), ('insects', 2), ('declines', 2), ('drivers', 2), ('appear', 2), ('taxa', 2), ('aquatic', 2), ('particular', 2)]","['Biodiversity', 'threatened', 'worldwide', 'Here', 'present', 'comprehensive', 'review', 'historical', 'reports', 'across', 'globe', 'systematically', 'assess', 'underlying', 'Our', 'work', 'reveals', 'dramatic', 'rates', 'decline', 'lead', 'extinction', 'world', 'next', 'decades', 'terrestrial', 'ecosystems', 'Lepidoptera', 'Hymenoptera', 'dung', 'beetles', 'Coleoptera', 'affected', 'four', 'major', 'Odonata', 'Plecoptera', 'Trichoptera', 'Ephemeroptera', 'lost', 'considerable', 'proportion', 'Affected', 'groups', 'include', 'specialists', 'occupy', 'ecological', 'common', 'Concurrently', 'abundance', 'small', 'number', 'increasing', 'adaptable', 'occupying', 'vacant', 'left', 'dietary', 'generalists', 'pollutant-tolerant', 'replacing', 'large', 'biodiversity', 'losses', 'experienced', 'within', 'order', 'importance', ':', 'loss', 'conversion', 'intensive', 'agriculture', 'urbanisation', 'ii', 'pollution', 'mainly', 'synthetic', 'pesticides', 'fertilisers', 'iii', 'biological', 'factors', 'including', 'pathogens', 'introduced', 'climate', 'change', 'latter', 'factor', 'particularly', 'important', 'tropical', 'regions', 'affects', 'minority', 'colder', 'climes', 'mountain', 'temperate', 'zones', 'rethinking', 'serious', 'reduction', 'pesticide', 'usage', 'substitution', 'sustainable', 'ecologically-based', 'urgently', 'needed', 'slow', 'reverse', 'trends', 'allow', 'recovery', 'populations', 'safeguard', 'vital', 'ecosystem', 'services', 'provide', 'addition', 'effective', 'remediation', 'technologies', 'applied', 'clean', 'polluted', 'environments']"

It is suggested to involve both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors including in the latter environmental toxins. Human exposure to the environmental toxin aluminium has been linked, if tentatively, to autism spectrum disorder. Herein we have used transversely heated graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry to measure, for the first time, the aluminium content of brain tissue from donors with a diagnosis of autism. We have also used an aluminium-selective fluor to identify aluminium in brain tissue using fluorescence microscopy. The aluminium content of brain tissue in autism was consistently high. The mean (standard deviation) aluminium content across all 5 individuals for each lobe were 3.82(5.42), 2.30(2.00), 2.79(4.05) and 3.82(5.17) Î¼g/g dry wt. for the occipital, frontal, temporal and parietal lobes respectively. These are some of the highest values for aluminium in human brain tissue yet recorded and one has to question why, for example, the aluminium content of the occipital lobe of a 15Â year old boy would be 8.74 (11.59) Î¼g/g dry wt.? Aluminium-selective fluorescence microscopy was used to identify aluminium in brain tissue in 10 donors. While aluminium was imaged associated with neurones it appeared to be present intracellularly in microglia-like cells and other inflammatory non-neuronal cells in the meninges, vasculature, grey and white matter. The pre-eminence of intracellular aluminium associated with non-neuronal cells was a standout observation in autism brain tissue and may offer clues as to both the origin of the brain aluminium as well as a putative role in autism spectrum disorder.",Human exposure to aluminiumHuman brain tissueAutism spectrum disorderTransversely heated atomic absorption spectrometryAluminium-selective fluorescence microscopy,"[('aluminium', 11), ('brain', 7), ('tissue', 6), ('autism', 5), ('disorder', 4), ('content', 4), ('spectrum', 3), ('environmental', 3), ('cells', 3), ('donors', 2)]","['Autism', 'neurodevelopmental', 'unknown', 'aetiology', 'It', 'suggested', 'involve', 'genetic', 'susceptibility', 'factors', 'including', 'latter', 'toxins', 'Human', 'exposure', 'toxin', 'linked', 'tentatively', 'Herein', 'transversely', 'heated', 'graphite', 'furnace', 'atomic', 'absorption', 'spectrometry', 'measure', 'first', 'time', 'diagnosis', 'We', 'aluminium-selective', 'fluor', 'consistently', 'high', 'mean', 'standard', 'deviation', 'across', 'individuals', 'frontal', 'temporal', 'parietal', 'lobes', 'respectively', 'highest', 'values', 'human', 'yet', 'recorded', 'question', 'example', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'would', 'Aluminium-selective', 'While', 'imaged', 'neurones', 'appeared', 'present', 'intracellularly', 'microglia-like', 'inflammatory', 'meninges', 'vasculature', 'grey', 'white', 'matter', 'pre-eminence', 'intracellular', 'standout', 'observation', 'offer', 'clues', 'origin', 'well', 'putative', 'role']"

This study investigated the role of the lipid signalling phospholipases D1 and D2 (PLD1/PLD2) in bleb formation in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line in the extracellular matrix, and reports that pharmacological inhibition of PLD1 and PLD2 with a potent universal PLD inhibitor potently inhibited bleb formation in HT1080 cells embedded in three-dimensional (3D) matrigel matrix. Use of smartpool small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target PLD1 and PLD2 isoforms at four different sequences revealed that PLD2, but not PLD1 is involved in blebbing of HT1080 cells.

Rhizobia adopt themselves in different environment including soil, rhizosphere and grown within legume roots, where they fix nitrogen. The establishment of symbiosis is a very complicated process involving a coordinated exchange of signal between legume plants and the symbionts. The nodule development requires synthesis of signal molecules such as Nod factors that are important for induction of nodule development. There are different types of surface polysaccharides such as lipopolysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides, neutral and acidic polysaccharides found in rhizobia. The production of symbiotically active polysaccharides may allow rhizobial strains to adapt themselves to changing environmental conditions and interact efficiently with legume plants. Despite extensive research, the actual molecular function of the surface polysaccharides of rhizobia in symbiosis remains unclear. This review emphasized on the structural composition of extracellular polysaccharide of different rhizobia isolated from different legume plants. The compositions of extracellular polysaccharides are different in different rhizobia. The various compositions of extracellular polysaccharides produced by the symbionts are considered as the signaling molecules essential for determining host plant specificity. The present status of the biological functions of the exo-polysaccharide in symbiosis such as host specificity, successful invasion, formation of infection thread and induction of nodule formation in legume plants is also summarized here.",EPSextracellular polysaccharideCPScapsular polysaccharideLPSlipopolysaccharidesCGcyclic beta glucanKPSK-antigen polysaccharideNPneutral polysaccharideKeywordsRhizobium spp.Extracellular polysaccharideProductionCompositionSuccinoglycanGalactoglucan,"[('polysaccharides', 7), ('legume', 6), ('different', 6), ('rhizobia', 5), ('nodule', 4), ('plants', 4), ('symbiosis', 3), ('extracellular', 3), ('soil', 2), ('plant', 2)]","['symbiotic', 'diazotrophs', 'comprise', 'diverse', 'group', 'Gram', 'negative', 'bacteria', 'collectively', 'called', 'Rhizobia', 'adopt', 'environment', 'including', 'rhizosphere', 'grown', 'within', 'roots', 'fix', 'nitrogen', 'establishment', 'complicated', 'process', 'involving', 'coordinated', 'exchange', 'requires', 'synthesis', 'Nod', 'factors', 'important', 'There', 'types', 'lipopolysaccharides', 'capsular', 'neutral', 'acidic', 'production', 'symbiotically', 'active', 'allow', 'rhizobial', 'strains', 'adapt', 'changing', 'environmental', 'conditions', 'interact', 'efficiently', 'Despite', 'extensive', 'research', 'actual', 'molecular', 'function', 'remains', 'unclear', 'This', 'review', 'emphasized', 'structural', 'composition', 'polysaccharide', 'isolated', 'various', 'produced', 'considered', 'signaling', 'essential', 'determining', 'present', 'status', 'biological', 'functions', 'exo-polysaccharide', 'successful', 'invasion', 'infection', 'thread', 'summarized']"

The main livelihood of people living in the immediate vicinity of the river is paddy cultivation, and chronic kidney disease is reported among them. Farmers utilize different types of agricultural chemicals in their fields expecting bumper harvests. Several agricultural chemicals have been reported to contain toxic trace elements in Sri Lanka. Therefore, arsenic and cadmium might end up in the river water. The presence of these trace elements in the river water and sediments can result in their bioaccumulation in fish tissues. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of two trace elements in water and sediments, as well as in fish tissues (gills, kidney, liver and muscle) of three food fish species, Etroplus suratensis, Anabas testudineus and Channa striata during cultivating and non-cultivating seasons of the year. Further, the level of bioaccumulation of two trace elements in fish tissues in relation to the contamination level of water and sediments was assessed. Data were gathered for 43Â months. Arsenic and cadmium concentration in water showed a significant (PÂ <Â 0.05) seasonal variation. Generally, the two trace elements in the river water were highest during the cultivating seasons than in other seasons. In all species, both trace elements in the gills highly depended on the concentration in the water. In all species, two trace elements in water and sediment did not significantly affect the levels in muscle tissue.

In addition to; among all control and study group female workers there was significant positive correlation between VRT & ART and significant negative correlation between at dominant hand HGS & VRT as well as between at dominant hand HGS & ART. We also observed that dominant hand HGS was a significant predictor of VRT and ART and however there was no any significant variation in body mass index (BMI), sensory disability test (SDT) and cognitive function test (CFT) among both groups.ConclusionWe found that muscle strength (as measured by hand grip strength) was associated with improved reaction time.

Such extracellular miRNAs (ECmiRNAs) are remarkably stable in the extracellular harsh environment with the presence of high RNAse activity. Although the precise mechanisms of release of cellular miRNAs to extracellular environment remain largely unknown, recent studies suggest that the expression of these ECmiRNAs can be associated with patho-physiological condition of an organism.

However, these diets increase the risk of subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). Thus, maximizing milk production without incurring Sub-acute ruminal acidosis is a challenging most dairy producers. The main aims of this paper were to review available article on general aspects of Sub-acute ruminal acidosis and its consequence in dairy cattle by focusing on past and recent article and helping to update the current knowledge for early recognition and limit the associated negative impact in dairy industry. Sub-acute ruminal acidosis is a well-recognized and economically important digestive disorder found particularly in well-managed dairy cattle. It is a consequence of feeding high grain diets to dairy cows and characterized by daily episodes of low ruminal which generally occurs when ruminal pH stays in the range of 5.2 and 6 for a prolonged period resulting in depresses fiber digestion and possibly milk production. There is no typical clinical sign of illness in SARA affected cows. However, SARA is said to be associated with inflammations of different organs and tissues in dairy cows. Rumenocentesis remains the most reliable means of diagnosing SARA. The cow at risk to develop SARA includes cows in the early lactation, Primiparous cows and Cows grazing or fed with rapidly fermentable low fiber grass. SARA has long-term health and economic consequences, which include feed intake depression, fluctuations in feed intake, reduced diet digestibility, reduced milk yield, reduced milk fat percent, gastrointestinal damage, liver abscesses, and lameness. Apart from compromises to dairy cow health and economics, SARA is of concern for animal welfare reasons, since lameness and laminitis impact significantly on cow comfort and general well-being.

Life Sciences,Immunology and Microbiology,Challenging the proposed causes of the PCR plateau phase,"Biomolecular Detection and QuantificationVolume 17, March 2019, 100082",LindaJanssonabJohannesHedmanab,"Despite the wide-spread use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in various life-science applications, the causes of arrested amplicon generation in late cycles have not been confidently identified. This so-called plateau phase has been attributed to depletion or thermal break-down of primers or nucleotides, thermal inactivation of the DNA polymerase, and product accumulation resulting in competition between primer annealing and product re-hybridization as well as blocking of DNA polymerase by double-stranded amplicons. In the current study, we experimentally investigate the proposed limiting factors of PCR product formation. By applying robust and validated qPCR assays, we elucidate the impact of adding non-target and target amplicons to the reactions, mimicking the high amount of products in late PCR cycles. Further, the impact of increased primer concentrations and thermal stability of reagents are explored. Our results show that high amounts of non-target amplicons inhibit amplification by binding to the DNA polymerase, but that this effect is counteracted by addition of more DNA polymerase or prolonged annealing/extension times. Adding high amounts of target amplicons that also act as templates in the reaction is far less inhibitory to amplification, although a decrease in amplification rate is seen. When primer concentrations are increased, both amplification rates and end-product yields are elevated. Taken together, our results suggest that the main cause of PCR plateau formation is primer depletion and not product accumulation or degradation of reagents. We stress that a PCR plateau caused by primer depletion is assay-dependent, i.e. dependent on the primer design and primer characteristics such as the probability of primer-dimer formation. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of the major parameters controlling the PCR dynamics at later cycles and the limitations of continued product formation, which in the end can facilitate PCR optimization.",Amplicon yieldAmplification efficiencyDNA polymerasePCRPlateau phaseqPCR,"[('PCR', 7), ('primer', 7), ('polymerase', 5), ('product', 5), ('DNA', 4), ('amplicons', 4), ('formation', 4), ('amplification', 4), ('cycles', 3), ('plateau', 3)]","['Despite', 'wide-spread', 'chain', 'various', 'life-science', 'applications', 'causes', 'arrested', 'amplicon', 'generation', 'confidently', 'identified', 'so-called', 'phase', 'attributed', 'break-down', 'primers', 'nucleotides', 'inactivation', 'resulting', 'competition', 'annealing', 're-hybridization', 'well', 'blocking', 'double-stranded', 'current', 'study', 'experimentally', 'investigate', 'proposed', 'limiting', 'factors', 'By', 'applying', 'robust', 'validated', 'qPCR', 'assays', 'elucidate', 'adding', 'reactions', 'mimicking', 'amount', 'products', 'Further', 'stability', 'explored', 'inhibit', 'binding', 'effect', 'counteracted', 'addition', 'prolonged', 'annealing/extension', 'times', 'Adding', 'act', 'templates', 'far', 'less', 'inhibitory', 'although', 'decrease', 'rate', 'seen', 'When', 'rates', 'end-product', 'yields', 'elevated', 'Taken', 'together', 'suggest', 'cause', 'degradation', 'We', 'stress', 'caused', 'assay-dependent', 'i.e', 'dependent', 'design', 'characteristics', 'probability', 'primer-dimer', 'findings', 'contribute', 'improved', 'understanding', 'major', 'parameters', 'controlling', 'dynamics', 'later', 'limitations', 'continued', 'end', 'facilitate', 'optimization']"

Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify the induction of antibodies against fifteen M. hyopneumoniae antigens, strongly recognized by the swine immune system during natural infection, in mice vaccinated with six commercial bacterins. Each group of mice was inoculated with one bacterin, and seroconversion was assessed by indirect ELISA using recombinant antigens and M. hyopneumoniae 7448 whole cell extract. Sera from one inoculated group recognized antigen MHP_0067, and sera from four inoculated groups recognized antigens MHP_0513 and MHP_0580. None of the bacterins was able to induce seroconversion against the twelve remaining antigens. This absence of a serological response could be attributed to the lack of antigen expression in M. hyopneumoniae strains used in bacterin production. Additionally the partial protection provided by these vaccines could be due to low expression or misfolding of antigens during vaccine preparation.

Vaccination studies mostly use tachyzoite specific proteins however in natural route of infection, toxoplasmosis initiates with tissue cysts (bradyzoites) or oocysts (sporozoites) and thereafter stage conversion takes place where the tachyzoites take action and cause acute infection continues with tachyzoites. Despite this knowledge, challenging models used in the vaccination studies prefer administration of tissue cyst forming strains intraperitoneally or subcutaneously instead of oral administration which is the natural route of infection. In the present study, a multivalent adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccine that contains bradyzoite specific BAG1 and tachyzoite specific GRA1 protein and controls were administered to female Swiss Webster outbred mice. Humoral and cellular immune responses were analyzed by Rec-ELISA, Western blot, and flow cytometry. Mice were infected orally with T. gondii PRU strain tissue cysts using feeding needle to mimic the natural route of infection. 40Â days after challenging microscopy and Real Time PCR were performed to determine the protection level.Analysis of sera obtained from vaccinated mice showed strong anti-BAG1 and anti-GRA1 IgG responses. The IgG2a response was significantly higher (PÂ <Â 0.0001) and the ratio of CD8Â +Â T lymphocytes secreting IFN-Î³ almost doubled compared to PBS control which are indicative of protection against toxoplasmosis. The amount of tissue cysts in vaccinated group was reduced 10.5% compared to control group.To generate a protective vaccine against toxoplasmosis, multistage vaccines and usage of challenging models mimicking natural route of infection are critical cornerstones.

A quadrivalent, inactivated, split-virion influenza vaccine (IIV4) containing strains from both B lineages has been developed to address this. We performed an open-label phase III study to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the 2013â2014 Northern Hemisphere formulation of IIV4 in children and adolescents 9â17Â years of age in Taiwan. Participants were vaccinated with one dose of IIV4 by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. Hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) titers were measured before and 21Â days after vaccination. Solicited injection-site and systemic reactions were assessed for up to 7Â days after vaccination, and adverse events (AEs) were recorded until day 21. One hundred participants were included. Despite relatively high pre-vaccination titers, post-vaccination HAI titers increased for all four strains, with geometric mean ratios (day 21/day 0) of 2.29 for A(H1N1), 2.05 for A(H3N2), 3.33 for B/Massachusetts (Yamagata lineage), and 4.59 for B/Brisbane (Victoria lineage). Post-vaccination seroprotection rates were 99% for A(H3N2) and 100% for A(H1N1), B/Massachusetts, and B/Brisbane. Due to high pre-vaccination titers, rates of seroconversion/significant increase of HAI titer were relatively low at 24% for A(H1N1), 20% for A(H3N2), 39% for B/Massachusetts, and 48% for B/Brisbane. Injection-site pain (56%), myalgia (45%), and malaise (15%) were the most frequently reported solicited reactions, and most solicited reactions were mild or moderate. No treatment-related AEs, immediate unsolicited AEs, unsolicited non-serious injection-site AEs, grade 3 unsolicited AEs, or serious AEs were reported.

In addition, immunization with this single and small 14Â kDa polypeptide resulted in protracted progression of the infection of the animals after challenging with a high dose of virulent L. infantum. Five months after challenge the parasite load was lower in the bone marrow of immunized dogs compared to non-immunized animals. The antibody response to K39, a marker of active VL, at ten months after challenge was strong and significantly higher in the control dogs than in vaccinated animals. At the study termination vaccinated animals showed significantly more liver granulomas and lymphoid hyperplasia than non-vaccinated animals, which are both histological markers of resistance to infection.

The introduction of single genome amplification (SGA) has been a major advancement in the field, allowing for the characterization of multiple sequences per patient while preserving linkage among polymorphisms in the same viral genome copy. Sequencing of SGA amplicons is performed by capillary Sanger sequencing, which presents low throughput, requires a high amount of template, and is highly sensitive to template/primer mismatching. In order to meet the increasing demand for HIV-1 SGA amplicon sequencing, we have developed a platform based on benchtop next-generation sequencing (NGS) (IonTorrent) accompanied by a bioinformatics pipeline capable of running on computer resources commonly available at research laboratories. During assay validation, the NGS-based sequencing of 10 HIV-1 env SGA amplicons was fully concordant with Sanger sequencing.

Active case finding (ACF) for TB has been recognized as an important complementary strategy to PCF, in order to diagnose and treat patients earlier, reducing the period of infectiousness and therefore transmission. ACF may also achieve substantial population-level TB control. Local TB epidemiology and the resources available in each setting will influence which populations should be screened, and the types of ACF interventions to use for maximal impact.

Life Sciences,Immunology and Microbiology,qPCR data analysis: Better results through iconoclasm,"Biomolecular Detection and QuantificationVolume 17, March 2019, 100084",JoelTellinghuisenaAndrej-NikolaiSpiessb,"The standard approach for quantitative estimation of genetic materials with qPCR is calibration with known concentrations for the target substance, in which estimates of the quantification cycle (Cq) are fitted to a straight-line function of log(N0), where N0 is the initial number of target molecules. The location of Cq for the unknown on this line then yields its N0. The most widely used definition for Cq is an absolute threshold that falls in the early growth cycles. This usage is flawed as commonly implemented: threshold set very close to the baseline level, which is estimated separately, from designated ""baseline cycles."" The absolute threshold is especially poor for dealing with the scale variability often observed for growth profiles. Scale-independent markers, like the first derivative maximum (FDM) and a relative threshold (Cr) avoid this problem. We describe improved methods for estimating these and other Cq markers and their standard errors, from a nonlinear algorithm that fits growth profiles to a 4-parameter log-logistic function plus a baseline function. Further, by examining six multidilution, multireplicate qPCR data sets, we find that nonlinear expressions are often preferred statistically for the dependence of Cq on log(N0). This means that the amplification efficiency E depends on N0, in violation of another tenet of qPCR analysis. Neglect of calibration nonlinearity leads to biased estimates of the unknown. By logic, E estimates from calibration fitting pertain to the earliest baseline cycles, not the early growth cycles used to estimate E from growth profiles for single reactions. This raises concern about the use of the latter in lengthy extrapolations to estimate N0. Finally, we observe that replicate ensemble standard deviations greatly exceed predictions, implying that much better results can be achieved from qPCR through better experimental procedures, which likely include reducing pipette volume uncertainty.","PCRquantitative polymerase chain reactiony and y0fluorescence signal above baseline at cycle x and at cycle 0Eamplification efficiencyCqquantification cycleyqsignal at x = CqN0initial number of target molecules in sampleCtthreshold cycle, where y = yqFDM and SDMcycles where y reaches its maximal first and second derivatives, respectivelyCy0intersection of a straight line tangent to the curve at the FDM with the baseline-corrected x-axisLSleast squaresÎ§2chi-squarewistatistical weight for ith data pointÏ2a and Ïvariance and standard deviationSsum of weighted, squared residuals (= ""Chisq"" in KaleidaGraph fit results, = Î§2 when wi = 1/Ïi2)Î½statistical degrees of freedom, = # of data points - # of adjustable parametersSDstandard deviationSEparameter standard errorKeywordsqPCRData analysisWeighted least squaresStatistical errorsChi-squareCalibration","[('Cq', 5), ('growth', 5), ('qPCR', 4), ('threshold', 4), ('cycles', 4), ('baseline', 4), ('standard', 3), ('calibration', 3), ('estimates', 3), ('function', 3)]","['approach', 'quantitative', 'estimation', 'genetic', 'materials', 'known', 'concentrations', 'substance', 'quantification', 'cycle', 'fitted', 'straight-line', 'initial', 'number', 'molecules', 'location', 'line', 'yields', 'widely', 'definition', 'falls', 'usage', 'flawed', 'commonly', 'implemented', 'set', 'close', 'level', 'estimated', 'separately', 'designated', '``', ""''"", 'especially', 'poor', 'dealing', 'scale', 'variability', 'observed', 'Scale-independent', 'like', 'first', 'derivative', 'maximum', 'FDM', 'relative', 'Cr', 'avoid', 'problem', 'describe', 'improved', 'methods', 'estimating', 'errors', 'algorithm', 'fits', '4-parameter', 'log-logistic', 'plus', 'Further', 'examining', 'six', 'multidilution', 'multireplicate', 'data', 'sets', 'find', 'expressions', 'preferred', 'statistically', 'dependence', 'means', 'amplification', 'efficiency', 'depends', 'violation', 'another', 'tenet', 'analysis', 'Neglect', 'nonlinearity', 'leads', 'biased', 'By', 'logic', 'fitting', 'pertain', 'earliest', 'single', 'reactions', 'raises', 'concern', 'latter', 'lengthy', 'extrapolations', 'Finally', 'observe', 'replicate', 'ensemble', 'deviations', 'greatly', 'exceed', 'predictions', 'implying', 'results', 'achieved', 'experimental', 'procedures', 'likely', 'include', 'reducing', 'pipette', 'volume', 'uncertainty']"

That is the concept of âpost-primaryâ TB described as the reactivation of dormant bacilli hidden in an old lesion developed during infancy due to a type of local immunosuppression. Intriguingly, this concept involves at least two major uncertainties: how can dormant bacilli remain for such a long period, almost a lifetime, in an old lesion, taking into account granuloma dynamism; and what sort of local immunosuppression is the one that facilitates reactivation? The controversy between reactivation and exogenous reinfection as the cause of active TB started very soon in TB research. Interestingly, this âbalanceâ was disturbed in the 1960s when the âUnitary Conceptâ became very successful in supporting the reactivation dogma. The âUnitary Conceptâ was mainly based on the data of tuberculin surveillance during the pre-antibiotic era as well as the data obtained from experimental modelling in animals. At the same time, the âThree-risks modelâ appeared to explain the relationship between the risk of infection and TB incidence, granting reinfection a key role in adult TB together with primary infection. This role was reinforced by the studies of recurrence based on molecular epidemiology, and a better knowledge of the immune response, granuloma dynamics, and lung physiology.

Identification of these cells is however difficult, especially when the cells often are rare and methods not sensitive, specific or practical enough. We propose a novel method of processing antigens before stimulation of cells which consists of covalently binding protein antigen to superparamagnetic micro-beads and using denaturing washes to remove contaminants. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors were stimulated using both cytomegalovirus and tetanus-diphtheria antigen-beads as well as non-antigenic protein-beads as negative control in an IFNÎ³ FluoroSpot assay in order to detect Th1 and CD8+ responses. The responses toward the antigen beads were both antigen specific and sensitive, with a detection threshold of 1 IFNÎ³ producing T-cell per 15,000 PBMCs.â¢Covalently binding antigen to paramagnetic beads allows for harsh denaturing washes without loss of antigen.â¢Microbeads are phagocytosed by antigen presenting cells, resulting in efficient uptake, processing and presentation of the antigens.â¢The method allows the usage of relatively impure starting antigen material and whole PBMC samples without high background levels in follow up cellular assays.",T-cellin-vitro assayantigenantigen processingmicroparticles,"[('antigen', 7), ('cells', 6), ('sensitive', 3), ('specific', 3), ('responses', 3), ('detection', 2), ('method', 2), ('processing', 2), ('binding', 2), ('denaturing', 2)]","['Reliable', 'essential', 'several', 'fields', 'research', 'whether', 'concerns', 'monitoring', 'infectious', 'agents', 'exploring', 'auto-antigen', 'repertoire', 'autoimmune', 'diseases', 'Identification', 'however', 'difficult', 'especially', 'often', 'rare', 'methods', 'practical', 'enough', 'propose', 'novel', 'antigens', 'stimulation', 'consists', 'covalently', 'protein', 'superparamagnetic', 'micro-beads', 'remove', 'contaminants', 'Peripheral', 'blood', 'mononuclear', 'PBMCs', 'healthy', 'donors', 'stimulated', 'cytomegalovirus', 'tetanus-diphtheria', 'antigen-beads', 'well', 'non-antigenic', 'protein-beads', 'negative', 'control', 'FluoroSpot', 'assay', 'order', 'detect', 'Th1', 'CD8+', 'toward', 'threshold', '1', 'producing', 'T-cell', 'per', '15,000', 'PBMCs.â¢Covalently', 'paramagnetic', 'harsh', 'loss', 'antigen.â¢Microbeads', 'phagocytosed', 'presenting', 'resulting', 'efficient', 'uptake', 'presentation', 'antigens.â¢The', 'usage', 'relatively', 'impure', 'starting', 'material', 'whole', 'PBMC', 'samples', 'background', 'levels', 'follow', 'cellular', 'assays']"

As a consequence, the safety of arches should not be assessed by means of a safety factor based on material strength as for conventional structures.

In this context, we have recently developed a method capable of computing the line of thrust closest to the geometrical axis and defining a safety factor based on the comparison between such a line of thrust and the profile of the arch, which we have denoted as âperformance factorâ.

The main livelihood of people living in the immediate vicinity of the river is paddy cultivation, and chronic kidney disease is reported among them. Farmers utilize different types of agricultural chemicals in their fields expecting bumper harvests. Several agricultural chemicals have been reported to contain toxic trace elements in Sri Lanka. Therefore, arsenic and cadmium might end up in the river water. The presence of these trace elements in the river water and sediments can result in their bioaccumulation in fish tissues. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of two trace elements in water and sediments, as well as in fish tissues (gills, kidney, liver and muscle) of three food fish species, Etroplus suratensis, Anabas testudineus and Channa striata during cultivating and non-cultivating seasons of the year. Further, the level of bioaccumulation of two trace elements in fish tissues in relation to the contamination level of water and sediments was assessed. Data were gathered for 43Â months. Arsenic and cadmium concentration in water showed a significant (PÂ <Â 0.05) seasonal variation. Generally, the two trace elements in the river water were highest during the cultivating seasons than in other seasons. In all species, both trace elements in the gills highly depended on the concentration in the water. In all species, two trace elements in water and sediment did not significantly affect the levels in muscle tissue. Therefore, the trace element levels in the edible parts of these three fish were well below the maximum permissible levels of international institutions.",ArsenicBioaccumulationCadmiumFishTrace elementsWater,"[('trace', 8), ('water', 8), ('elements', 7), ('river', 5), ('fish', 5), ('sediments', 3), ('tissues', 3), ('species', 3), ('seasons', 3), ('levels', 3)]","['upper', 'Malwathu', 'Oya', 'livelihood', 'people', 'living', 'immediate', 'vicinity', 'paddy', 'cultivation', 'chronic', 'disease', 'Farmers', 'utilize', 'different', 'types', 'fields', 'expecting', 'bumper', 'harvests', 'Several', 'contain', 'toxic', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'arsenic', 'might', 'end', 'result', 'purpose', 'study', 'investigate', 'liver', 'food', 'Etroplus', 'suratensis', 'Anabas', 'testudineus', 'Channa', 'striata', 'non-cultivating', 'year', 'Further', 'relation', 'contamination', 'assessed', 'Data', 'gathered', 'months', 'Arsenic', 'showed', 'significant', 'P', 'variation', 'Generally', 'highest', 'highly', 'depended', 'sediment', 'significantly', 'affect', 'tissue', 'element', 'edible', 'parts', 'maximum', 'permissible', 'international', 'institutions']"

This study investigated the role of the lipid signalling phospholipases D1 and D2 (PLD1/PLD2) in bleb formation in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line in the extracellular matrix, and reports that pharmacological inhibition of PLD1 and PLD2 with a potent universal PLD inhibitor potently inhibited bleb formation in HT1080 cells embedded in three-dimensional (3D) matrigel matrix.

Aberrant expression of miRNAs is observed in diverse disease and altered physiological states. Recently, it has been revealed that miRNAs are not only present in cells but also in extracellular milieu especially in different bio-fluids including blood plasma, follicular fluid and even in cell culture media. Such extracellular miRNAs (ECmiRNAs) are remarkably stable in the extracellular harsh environment with the presence of high RNAse activity. Although the precise mechanisms of release of cellular miRNAs to extracellular environment remain largely unknown, recent studies suggest that the expression of these ECmiRNAs can be associated with patho-physiological condition of an organism. Moreover, these ECmiRNAs may deliver to the recipient cells via certain pathways where they can regulate translational activity of target genes. This review will discuss the nature and stability of ECmiRNAs along with their release mechanisms.

For the analyses, we used at dominant and non- dominant hand; hand grip strength (HGS), reaction time task, sensory disability test (SDT) and cognitive function test (CFT) among both the groups.ResultWe observed that visual reaction time (VRT) and auditory reaction time (ART) were significantly improved in dominant hand of study group, when compare to control group; however it was comparable in non-dominant hand among both the groups. In addition to; among all control and study group female workers there was significant positive correlation between VRT & ART and significant negative correlation between at dominant hand HGS & VRT as well as between at dominant hand HGS & ART. We also observed that dominant hand HGS was a significant predictor of VRT and ART and however there was no any significant variation in body mass index (BMI), sensory disability test (SDT) and cognitive function test (CFT) among both groups.ConclusionWe found that muscle strength (as measured by hand grip strength) was associated with improved reaction time.

In this review, we summarize the history and methods of clonal analysis as well as highlight key findings revealed by single-cell lineage tracking of stem cells in developing and adult brains across different animal models.",In vivo clonal analysisLineage tracingNeural stem cellsNeural developmentNuclear brain structure,"[('cells', 3), ('clonal', 3), ('analysis', 3), ('adult', 2), ('neural', 2), ('stem', 2), ('NSCs', 2), ('tracking', 2), ('methods', 2), ('lineage', 2)]","['Single', 'embryonic', 'characterized', 'self-renewal', 'differentiation', 'potential', 'Lineage', 'tracing', 'allows', 'specific', 'labeling', 'single', 'NSC', 'progeny', 'throughout', 'development', 'five', 'decades', 'plethora', 'developed', 'tandem', 'integration', 'chemical', 'genetic', 'imaging', 'sequencing', 'techniques', 'Applications', 'approaches', 'gained', 'diverse', 'insights', 'heterogeneous', 'behavior', 'relationships', 'molecular', 'regulation', 'fate', 'specification', 'ontogeny', 'complex', 'tissues', 'review', 'summarize', 'history', 'well', 'highlight', 'key', 'findings', 'revealed', 'single-cell', 'developing', 'brains', 'across', 'different', 'animal']"

The present dataset focus on mass spectrometry method for detection of human hepatitis C virus core antigen (HCV core Ag) taking into account the potential modification with cations in blood serum samples, using mica chips for the atomic force microscopy (AFM-chips). To conduct specific protein fishing, we used flat AFM-chips preliminary sensibilized with molecular probes â aptamers, which are single-stranded DNA sequences. In our study we used four types of aptamers up to 85 nucleotides specific against the target protein â HCVcoreAg [3,4]. Working (n=19) and control (n=11) AFM-chips with aptamers were preliminarily immobilized on the surface in four zones and incubated in blood serum samples (See Supplementary fig.1).

The mechanism to regain the proliferative capacity of adult cardiomyocytes is a challenge. However, recent studies are promising in showing that the âlockedâ cell cycle of adult cardiomyocytes could be released through modulation of cell cycle checkpoints. In support of this are the signaling pathways of Notch, Hippo, Wnt, Akt and Jak/Stat that facilitate or inhibit the transition at cell cycle checkpoints. Cyclins and cyclin dependant kinases (CDKs) facilitate this transition which in turn is regulated by inhibitory action of pocket protein e.g. p21, p27 and p57. Transcription factors e.g. E2F, GATA4, TBx20 up regulate Cyclin A, A2, D, E, and CDK4 as promoters of cell cycle and Meis-1 and HIF-1 alpha down regulate cyclin D and E to inhibit the cell cycle. Paracrine factors like Neuregulin-1, IGF-1 and Oncostatin M and Extracellular Matrix proteins like Agrin have been involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation and dedifferentiation processes.A molecular switch model is proposed that transforms the post mitotic cell into an actively dividing cell. This model shows how the cell cycle is regulated through on- and off switch mechanisms through interaction of transcription factors and signaling pathways with proteins of the cell cycle checkpoints. Signals triggered by injury may activate the right combination of the various pathways that can âswitch onâ the proliferation signals leading to myocardial regeneration.",Cell cycleHeart regenerationCardiomyocyte proliferationCyclins,"[('cell', 9), ('cycle', 7), ('adult', 3), ('proliferation', 3), ('checkpoints', 3), ('pathways', 3), ('factors', 3), ('switch', 3), ('cardiomyocyte', 2), ('injury', 2)]","['review', 'deals', 'human', 'potential', 'source', 'heart', 'repair', 'mechanism', 'regain', 'proliferative', 'capacity', 'challenge', 'However', 'recent', 'studies', 'promising', 'showing', 'locked', 'released', 'modulation', 'support', 'Notch', 'Hippo', 'Wnt', 'Akt', 'Jak/Stat', 'Cyclins', 'dependant', 'kinases', 'CDKs', 'turn', 'inhibitory', 'action', 'pocket', 'protein', 'p21', 'p27', 'p57', 'Transcription', 'E2F', 'GATA4', 'TBx20', 'Cyclin', 'A2', 'CDK4', 'promoters', 'Meis-1', 'HIF-1', 'alpha', 'Paracrine', 'Neuregulin-1', 'IGF-1', 'Oncostatin', 'Extracellular', 'Matrix', 'Agrin', 'involved', 'dedifferentiation', 'processes.A', 'molecular', 'proposed', 'transforms', 'post', 'mitotic', 'actively', 'dividing', 'shows', 'on-', 'mechanisms', 'interaction', 'transcription', 'Signals', 'triggered', 'activate', 'right', 'combination', 'various', 'signals', 'leading', 'myocardial', 'regeneration']"

As opposed to other HDACs, they lack catalytic function and bind transcription factors to recruit transcriptional co-regulators, mostly co-repressors such as nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR)/silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT). Class IIa HDACs enhance mouse somatic cell reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by repressing the function of the pro-mesenchymal transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), which is upregulated during this process. Here, we describe, using HDAC4 and 7 as examples, that class IIa HDACs exhibit nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking in reprogramming, being mostly cytoplasmic in donor fibroblasts and intermediate cells but translocating to the nucleus in iPSCs. Importantly, over-expressing a mutant form of HDAC4 or 7 that becomes trapped in the nucleus enhances the early phase of reprogramming but is deleterious afterwards. The latter effect is mediated through binding to the exogenous reprogramming factors at pluripotency loci, and the subsequent recruitment of NCoR/SMRT co-repressors. Thus, our findings uncover a context-dependent function of class IIa HDACs in reprogramming and further reinforce the idea that recruitment of co-repressors by the exogenous factors is a major obstacle for reactivating the pluripotency network in this process.",Somatic cell reprogrammingiPSCsClass IIa HDACsNCoR/SMRT co-repressorsMesenchymal-to-epithelial transitionPluripotency,"[('HDACs', 6), ('reprogramming', 5), ('IIa', 4), ('function', 3), ('factors', 3), ('co-repressors', 3), ('Class', 2), ('transcription', 2), ('mostly', 2), ('receptor', 2)]","['histone', 'deacetylases', 'subfamily', 'important', 'functions', 'development', 'adult', 'tissue', 'homeostasis', 'opposed', 'lack', 'catalytic', 'bind', 'recruit', 'transcriptional', 'co-regulators', 'nuclear', 'co-repressor', 'NCoR', '/silencing', 'mediator', 'retinoid', 'thyroid', 'hormone', 'SMRT', 'enhance', 'mouse', 'somatic', 'cell', 'induced', 'pluripotent', 'stem', 'repressing', 'pro-mesenchymal', 'myocyte', 'enhancer', '2', 'MEF2', 'upregulated', 'Here', 'describe', 'examples', 'exhibit', 'nuclear-cytoplasmic', 'trafficking', 'cytoplasmic', 'donor', 'fibroblasts', 'intermediate', 'translocating', 'Importantly', 'over-expressing', 'mutant', 'form', 'becomes', 'trapped', 'enhances', 'early', 'phase', 'deleterious', 'afterwards', 'latter', 'effect', 'mediated', 'binding', 'loci', 'subsequent', 'NCoR/SMRT', 'Thus', 'findings', 'uncover', 'context-dependent', 'reinforce', 'idea', 'major', 'obstacle', 'reactivating', 'network']"
